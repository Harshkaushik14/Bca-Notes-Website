Diffrentiation b/w Function Overloading & fFunction overrriding



* Function overloading occurs in the same class whem we declare the same function but having different arguments in same class.
* Function overriding occurs in the child class when child class overrides parent class functiom.
* In function overloading function signature of All overloding function should be different.
* In function overriding function signature of both (overriding & overridden)function shouldd be the same.
* Function overloading occurs at compile time that's why it is also known as Compile Time Polymorphism.
* Function overriding occurs at run time that's why it is also known as Run Time Polyorphism.
* In Function Overloading we can have any number of overloaded function.
* In function Overridding we can have only 1 overriden function.
